    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Serves: 6</h3>
    <h3>Time: 60 min</h3>
    <p>
      A classic Chinese dish, gloriously messy to eat, wonderfully tasty and low
      in carbs! What more could you want?
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>500 g ground chicken (or pork)</li>
      <li>3 cm fresh ginger - peeled & sliced very finely</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>2 spring onions</li>
      <li>1 stalk celery</li>
      <li>1 (220 g) can water chestnuts</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon dry sherry or sake (personal choice, I prefer the Sherry in
        this dish)
      </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 tsp chilli flakes (optional to add a little extra spice)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the ginger (about 3 cm peeled and sliced very finely).</li>
      <li>Slice the garlic very finely.</li>
      <li>Chop the spring onions.</li>
      <li>Dice the celery into very small cubes.</li>
      <li>Chop the water chestnuts, again into very small cubes (5 mm).</li>
      <li>Put the above ingredients to one side.</li>
      <li>
        Wash the lettuce, dry, and being careful not to tear the leaves,
        separate leaves keeping them whole.
      </li>
      <li>Pat dry and put to one side.</li>
      <li>
        In a small bowl mix together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, dry sherry and
        sugar. Do not leave out the sugar as it just won't be the same!
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the sesame oil in a non-stick frying pan on high heat. Add the
        garlic, ginger, and spring onions and fry until the garlic and ginger
        are aromatic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the minced pork and cook until the pork is browned. Remove from the
        pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water chestnuts, and celery to the frying pan and cook over a
        medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then put the sauce mixture in the pan and stir. Add the chilli flakes at
        this point if you are using them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then put the pork back in the pan and continue to cook at medium heat
        until sauce is reduced and mixture becomes dryer and the pork is
        browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        To serve; lay out a lettuce leaf and spoon a great big heap of the
        cooked mixture into the middle and fold into a wrap and eat immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
